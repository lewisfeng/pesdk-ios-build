# About PhotoEditor SDK for iOS

Our SDK provides tools for adding photo editing capabilities to your iOS application with a big variety of filters that can be previewed in realtime. Unlike other apps that allow a live preview of filters, the PhotoEditor SDK even provides a live preview when using high-resolution images. The framework is written in Swift and allows for easy customization.
Additionally we support adding stickers and text in a non-destructive manner, which means that you can change the position, size, scale and order at any given time, even after applying other effects or cropping the photo.

## Features

* 62 stunning built in filters to choose from.
* Native code: Our rendering engine is based on Apple's Core Image, therefore we dodge all the nasty OpenGL problems other frameworks face.
* iPad support: The PhotoEditor SDK uses auto layout for its views and adapts to each screen size - iPhone or iPad.
* Design filters in Photoshop: With most photo editing frameworks you have to tweak values in code or copy & paste them from Photoshop or your favorite image editor. With our response technology that is a thing of the past. Design your filter in Photoshop, once you are done apply it onto the provided identity image. That will 'record' the filter response - save it, add it as new filter, done!
* Swift: Keeping up with time, we chose Swift as the main development language of the PhotoEditor SDK, leading to leaner easier code.
* Live preview: Filters can be previewed directly in the camera preview.
* Low memory footprint: We were able to reduce our memory footprint significantly.
* Non-destructive: Don't like what you did? No problem, just redo or even discard it.
* Highly customizable: Style the UI as you wish to match your needs.
* Objective-C support: Most of our public API is Objective-C compatible.
* Fast: Our renderer uses hardware acceleration and the GPU, which makes it lightning fast.
